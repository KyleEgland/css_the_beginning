# CSS - The Beginning
This is the start of my venture into learning (or, more correctly, relearning) CSS.

## Synopsis
As I get further into learning about making web apps, I needed learn CSS if I wanted to shed frameworks (started with [No Framework Web App](https://github.com/KyleEgland/no_framework_web_app)).  Now, I'd like to drop using bootstrap simply because I don't want to (potentially) be caught out by changes they make (or don't make in the case of security flaws - not sure if CSS can be a vector but you never know?).

## Overview
* CSS = Cascading Stylesheets
* CSS is **NOT** a programming language
* Used for website layout and design
* Can be extended with a variety of other technologies (most likely not covered here)

## Requirements
All that is needed (if you desire to play with the docs) is a web browser (I.e. Google's Chrome or Mozilla's Firefox) and a text editor (I use [Atom](https://atom.io/)).  I have also included a very simple Python 3 server script (if you have Python 3 that is).  Otherwise, there is an executable created from it for Windows.  Beyond that (Mac and Linux) I don't have a "batteries included" solution but you can just open the file with your browser.  (So then why the server Kyle?) Because I like it :)

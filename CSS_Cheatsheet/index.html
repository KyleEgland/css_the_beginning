    <!-- There are 3 ways of adding CSS to your HTML doc: -->
    <!-- * Inline CSS: Directly in the html element(s) -->
    <!--    **This is a bad practice -->
    <!-- * Internal CSS: Using <style> tags within the html document -->
    <!--    ** Not recommended because it adds a lot to your html doc -->
    <!--    ** Also only works in the one document -->
    <!-- * External CSS: Referencing an external .css file with the doc -->

            This is just some sample text, here to do nothing more than exist for
            Kyle's amuzement as he whiles away the time typing. All work and no
            play, as they say, makes Kyle a dull boy...but we'll have none of that
            now, will we?
            Just gonna keep on writing frivolous things, aren't you? *sigh* fine
            then, type on. We'll get back to learning and writing later I suppose.
            Like, maybe now? Or perhaps now is more appropriate then? Righ, now
            it is!
